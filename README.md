# Newzer

### The Idea

Newzer is a project aiming at offering a detailed view of the news industry.

In **analyzing** many newly posted **articles** in as much news websites as possible, it will be abble to reveal the **trending topics** of the moment, the general direction of the press on a given period of time, and can be a **powerful analyze tool** to understand the world of breaking news with a new angle.

### The Way

Eventhough still in **early development phase**, Newzer is thought to be **complete**.

Different bloc can be identified in the app architecture:

* Data __Acquiring__
* Raw material __Storage__
* News __Analysys__
* Processed data __Storage__
* Adaptable output __Display__
